# stem2019
React app for Stem Teacher interns of 2019

## Getting Started
There are a few tools that are suggested for working with this project.
Please install them before starting to work.

1. **git** - [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install.
2. **Node.js** - [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install.
3. **Visual Studio Code** - [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install.

You may use other tools if you are familiar with them, but this guide will assume you are using the suggested tools to get started.

### Creating a directory for your project
The code for your project needs a place on your computer for you to work with it effectively. If you don't already have a place that you would like to put this code, let's create a new folder on your desktop.

1. Right click on your desktop and find the option for `New -> Folder`.
Give it a name like code, development, projects, or whatever makes sense to you.
2. Next, right click on the folder that you just created and choose `Open with Code`

At this point you should have the project open in Visual Studio Code.

### Installing the current version of the project

1. At the top of Visual Studio Code, choose `Terminal -> New Terminal` from the menu.
2. A terminal (command line) appears, with the directory of your projects currently selected.
3. Type or copy and paste the following into the terminal and press enter:
`git clone https://github.com/justinbcain/stem2019.git`

If all went correctly, you should now have a copy of the code in a directory called `stem2019`.

4. In the terminal, type or copy and paste into the terminal `npm install`

This may take a little while, and when it finishes, should have downloaded all of the other code needed to use this project.
